# 🐍 Daily Python Practice 🚀

Welcome to my **Daily Python Practice** repository! 🎯  
Every day, I practice **Python programming topics** — from the absolute basics to more advanced concepts. This repository is my digital notebook where I experiment, learn, and grow as a programmer. 💡  

Each script I upload focuses on one or more of the following:
- 🔢 Understanding Python fundamentals (variables, datatypes, operators)
- 🧠 Practicing control statements like loops and conditions
- 🧮 Working with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- 🧰 Exploring functions, input/output, and file handling
- 🧩 Strengthening logical thinking and problem-solving
- 🚀 Gradually moving towards projects and real-world applications
